#### creating a spring boot app that can create a Jira ticket in an Atlassian Cloud instance and shows the created ticket afterward.

* The summary will be entered using Swagger ui to visualise the simple REST API (http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html)


* After the ticket was created via the Atlassian Rest API, the ticket should be shown as a JSON response in the SpringBoot app
